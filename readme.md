# Unity 3D Template

This is a simple template for getting started with a Unity project quickly. The purpose of this template is for personal use, so I won't be able to provide support if you decide to use this template for yourself.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- pyyaml package
- Bash (git bash or cygwin should work for Windows)

## Template Initialization
1. Clone the repo to an empty directory
2. Create a new empty remote repo (optional)
3. Add the project to the Unity Hub and then open it
4. Install paid assets through package manager:
    1. Rewired (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/rewired-21676
    2. Shapes (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/shapes-173167)
5. In the project root directory, run the following command: `./init_template.sh`
6. ???
7. Make the game!

## Directory Layout
`/Lib` contains common submodules that are pulled from GitHub. For example, script extensions.

`/Game` is where the scripts and assets specific to the current game being made will be placed.
